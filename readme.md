# Card Deck

The intent of this module is to provide methods for managing a deck and discard pile from a deck of generic cards.

The expectation is that cards will moved into and out of the deck, copy and clone are not used internally.

## Coming soon: 

A playing cards module that works well with this deck.

## Changes

### in v0.1.5

Added "dig\_for" and "dig\_all" methods for grabbing the first/all cards that match a filter respectively.
